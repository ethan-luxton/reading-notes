## Welcome to my Codefellows 102 Course page

My name is Ethan Luxton, I am currently learning web development and programming through CodeFellows. You can take a look at my [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/ethan-luxton), or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-luxton/).

### Growth Mindset

* Growth mindset is the practice of actively trying, and succeding or failing, at learning new things. And constantly trying to learn new things regardless of how impractical or impossible it seems.

#### Four things to remember to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Stay focused
2. Ask questions and seek help when necessary
3. Try different approaches
4. Take breaks and stay healthy

```python
print("Coding is fun :)")
```

Markdown Notes:

    Learning markdown syntax

    1. "#" for bold and header text
    2. "!" for links
    3. Code snippets
    4. Image links and hyperlinks
    5. Github features and resources
    6. GitHub Pages
    7. Markdown syntax is fairly similar to other markdown methods used in other programs. Microsoft Word, Adobe Suites, etc.
    
    
    
## Lab 02 Notes

> Writing the code is the easy part, the preperations take the most time.

This second lab focused mostly on installing a distribution of Linux (Ubuntu) onto a terminal virtual machine. As well as installing various packages and materials to connect with git, github and a code editor (VS code). As well as learning the difference and different uses between the terminal and a GUI file explorer. 

Some of the commands learned in this lab for the Ubuntu terminal were:
```console
sudo apt-get (insert package name here)
echo
eval
brew (if using Homebrew) (followed by install/update/upgrade etc)
```

While some commands learned for cmd/powershell were:
```console
wls
cd
mkdir
```

There are many more commands and ways to use both the linux based VM and powershell/cmd, however for the nature of the class it will be used to send pull requests and updates to git/github. This is made possible through a text/code editor or IDE, which is used to write and maintain code. The most widely used form of a text/code editor is Visual Studio code, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. This code editor is extremely powerful and works well with git and github. 

### Different classifications of text editors:

Text editors vary based on user preference and industry/company standard. The best examples of text editors widly used are:
1. VS Code
2. Notepad++
3. ATOM
4. CodeWrangler (for Mac users)
