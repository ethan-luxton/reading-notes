### Growth Mindset

* Growth mindset is the practice of actively trying, and succeding or failing, at learning new things. And constantly trying to learn new things regardless of how impractical or impossible it seems.

#### Four things to remember to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Stay focused
2. Ask questions and seek help when necessary
3. Try different approaches
4. Take breaks and stay healthy

```python
print("Coding is fun :)")
```
