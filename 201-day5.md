## # Code 201 - Week One - Day five Notes -

### HTML Media

1. Alt has an important real world use: SEO & Accessibility. Alt attributes give descriptions that can provide image context for search engines. It is also useful for accessability and read-ability through TTS (text to speach).
2. You can improve image accessability through alt text and titles, if it is purely decorative you can just use alt="". Avoid text inside the images.
3. The ```<figure>``` element defines self-contained content. This can include: illustrations, diagrams, photos and code listings.
4. A gif is a set of images combined into one that moves at a defined speed. Somewhat like a video, but with no sound. SVG is a large file that contains more information than a general JPG or PNG.
5. Generally I use JPG to display an screenshot on a website, however, occasionally I will use PNG to save space or use transparency. I have not experimented with GIFs or SVGs yet.

### Learning CSS

1. Background color is the color that is set to the background of a specific element. This means you can have multiple background colors in multiple places at the same time. Forground color is applied to all text within the element. 
2. I would get a color pallet to use on the website. Editing specific things like text, elements and containers to use specific colors. A color pallet typically contains 5~ colors.
3. Consitency between fonts. Don't choose totally different fonts across the page.
4. font-size changes the size of fonts in the element. font-weight changes how bold the text is. font-style has many different styles to change to, such as italic or oblique.
5. Two ways to add spacing around characters are: letter-spacing and the ```<length>``` element.

## Things I would like to learn more about 

1. I would love to learn more about animations in CSS, I have been playing around with them but there is so much more I don't know.
2. Grid-layout and how to set it up.
