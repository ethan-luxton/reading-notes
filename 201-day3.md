# Code 201 - Week One - Day Three Notes -

## Ordered and unordered lists -

1. Unordered lists are typically used when trying to group together a list of items in no particular order. Or with bullet points.

    * Unordered lists are also useful for CSS styling. You can use unordered list using the ```<ul>``` tag.

2. You can change the bullet style of unordered list using CSS through the list-style-type property.

3. An ordered list should be used when the need is to display a list item with a marker at the front. Typically a number or letter. Unordered lists should be used when little to no markers are desired.

4. You can change the list items on ordered lists with either ```type="" or start=""``` type changes the type of list beginning marker to whatever the type is, such as roman numerals. The start; starts at a specific number.

## CSS Tips and the box model -

Here are the parts of a block box in CSS as described from [MDN Web Docs:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

    Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

    Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

    Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

    Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## JavaScript Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals and Loops -

1. JavaScript arrays can store any and all types of data. From strings, integers, null, undefined, user input, etc.
2. Yes 'people' is a valid array in Javascript.

```js
const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
```
* This is because each set of values is stored in a nested array. This is where one array is stored inside of another, most of the time multiple arrays are stored. All items in each array are accessible.

3. Courtesy of [w3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp), here are some shorthand operators:
    1. ++ Increment
    2. -- Decrement
    3. += Same as x = x + y
    4. /= Same as x = x / y
    5. *= Same as x = x * y

4. Based on the code below:

```js
 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
```
* This statement will run and output 10dog if a console.log() is added, however, as it stands this does not output anything. The reason it outputs 10dog is because c is false therefore it only evaluates 10 + dog.

5. Conditional statements are primarily used when you want to decide a flow of execution in your program, if not x else y else z.
* A real world example being:
```js
let userInput = prompt("Is the pie good?");
if (userInput == 'yes' || 'y' ) {
    window.alert("The pie was good!")
} else {
    window.alert("The pie was not good!")
}
```

6. A loop is useful in JavaScript when you want to repeat a function or statement multiple times until a successful entry or condition is met. IE checking for names, emails, etc.

## Things I want to know more about: 

CSS Box styling and using open source CSS.
