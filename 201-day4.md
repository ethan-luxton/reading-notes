# Code 201 - Week One - Day four Notes -

## Creating hyperlinks

1. To create a hyperlink, the text is wrapped in a ```<a></a>``` tag. 
2. This tag usually includes a 'href' attribute which houses a link to a website or target.
3. You can add supporting information using the 'title' attribute. This can be a way to make the site more accessible to users.

## CSS Layout

1. Normal flow is the way HTML pages are laid out with little CSS. A normal flow is in essence multiple blocks on top of each other, spanning 100% of the parent element and with inline and block-level elements.
2. Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements only cover space from left to right as far as possible. Inline elements only cover the space they are bound to by HTML elements.
3. By default, all HTML elements are static in their positioning
4. Some benefits of absolute positioning are: cross-browser support (minus IE). Less dependant on floats. Less dependent on margins.
5. Fixed will stay wherever it is placed on the screen in the exact same spot and index relative to the browser window. Absolute is entirely removed from the document flow.

## More JavaScript

1. The key difference between a function declaration and invocation is the purpose.
    * A function is declared in this manner usually: ```function myFunction() {}```
    * A function is invoked when called upon: ```myFunction();```
    * Declaring the function allows code to be written inside of it, when the time comes to retrieve that code, the invocation is used to do so. Invocation can be done in the JavaScript file or in the HTML file. You can also add events for CSS in JavaScript.
2. A parameter is a variable in the function, loop or other method. An argument is what you pass to the parameter.

## Misc:

1. Pair-programming is great because you have two sets of eyes looking at the same code. This can catch mistakes, define better outcomes for code, and optimize speed and efficacy.
2. Pair-programming can also help you to learn new things about code because it teaches you to look at the problem from a different perspective. One way you might have solved the problem could have been solved entirely differently by someone else.

## Things I want to know more about

1. Functions in Javascript. What are the limits of it?
2. CSS. How and when to choose the correct type of position values and how to style them.
3. When is the proper time to decide when a for loop should be used and when a while loop should be used?
