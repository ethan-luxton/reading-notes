# Code 201 - Week One - Day Two Notes -

*This reading module is important as it has good information regarding how to format text within HTML to make sites look professional.*

### Reading questions:

**HTML** -

1. It is important to use semantic elements in HTML because it allows for greater accessibility in our sites. This accessability comes through things such as assistive tech, screen readers, search engine optimization, etc.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML? - This is answered below, there are 6.

3. ``<sup>`` and ``<sub>`` are short for superscript and subscript. These two tags will shrink and place text lower or higher than other text. For example:

    This is normal text<sup> next to higher text</sup>

    This is normal text <sub>next to lower text</sub>

    ``<sup>`` and ``<sub>`` Are mainly used in cases where the square root, exponent or another STEM term needs defining.

4. ``<abbr>`` is used to abbreviate text. Giving it a tooltip. For example:

    <p>We use <abbr title="Abbreviations">abbr</abbr> to abbreviate our web documents.</p>


**CSS** -

1. There are three different ways to apply CSS in HTML:
    * The first being inline
        ```html
        <p style="color:blue;">A blue paragraph</p>
        ```
    * The second being internal CSS
        ```html
         <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head>
                    <style>
                        body {background-color: powderblue;}
                        h1   {color: blue;}
                        p    {color: red;}
                    </style>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                </body>
            </html> 
        ```
    * The third being external CSS. This is its own .css file.

2. The reason to avoid inline css is because you want to seperate site functionality from site style. It keeps code clean and easy to read.

3. From this block of code:
    ```CSS
    h2 {
        color: black;
        padding: 5px;
    }
    ```
    1. The selector is h2.
    2. The CSS declarations are the brackets and its contents.
    3. The properties are 'color' and 'padding'.

**JavaScript** -

1. A datatype enclosed in single quote marks is considered a 'string'

2. 4 different types of operators in JS are: +, =, !=, &&. These four cover arithmetic, assignment, string, comparison, and logical operators. There are also type and bitwise operators. [A good resource can be found on w3.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

3. Simply put, math. Math equations are easily solved using functions.
    ```js
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    function myFunction(z) {
        z = x + y;
        console.log(z);
    }
    // This would log 15 in the console.
    ```

*Conditionals in JS questions*

1. An if statement checks a variable and if it evaluates to true the block will execute.

2. The use of an else if is to check if another entry or variable meets the conditions of the if statement. So if not x else y.

3. 3 different comparison operators include: === (strictly equal to), != (not equal to), and > (greater than). The rest can be found in the w3 link above.

4. Logical operators (&&, ||, !) represent three different uses.
    1. && is saying "if x && y = 10, then x and y equal 10"
    2. || is saying "if x || y = 10, then x or y equal 10"
    3. ! is saying " if x = !10, then x does not equal 10"
        * Side note these are not correct syntax for JS, just examples.
    
Another side note: *[Great resource on writing a commit message for git](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)*

## Basics of HTML formatting

**Headings and Paragraphs**

- Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.

In HTML each paragraph has to be wrapped in a p element:

```HTML
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:

```HTML
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```
```HTML
There are six heading elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading, <h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

```

### Ordered and unordered lists:

```HTML
<!-- Ordered list -->
<ol>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ol>

```
```HTML
<!-- Unordered list -->
<ul>
  <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
  <li>Turn right</li>
  <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
  <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
  <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
</ul>
