## Lab 02 Notes

> Writing the code is the easy part, the preperations take the most time.

This second lab focused mostly on installing a distribution of Linux (Ubuntu) onto a terminal virtual machine. As well as installing various packages and materials to connect with git, github and a code editor (VS code). As well as learning the difference and different uses between the terminal and a GUI file explorer. 

Some of the commands learned in this lab for the Ubuntu terminal were:
```console
sudo apt-get (insert package name here)
echo
eval
brew (if using Homebrew) (followed by install/update/upgrade etc)
```

While some commands learned for cmd/powershell were:
```console
wls (install linux/ubuntu VM)
cd and cd .. (change directory)
mkdir (create folder)
touch (create file)
cp (copy)
mv (move)
```

There are many more commands and ways to use both the linux based VM and powershell/cmd, however for the nature of the class it will be used to send pull requests and updates to git/github. This is made possible through a text/code editor or IDE, which is used to write and maintain code. The most widely used form of a text/code editor is Visual Studio code, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft. This code editor is extremely powerful and works well with git and github. 

### Different classifications of text editors:

Text editors vary based on user preference and industry/company standard. The best examples of text editors widly used are:
1. VS Code
2. Notepad++
3. ATOM
4. CodeWrangler (for Mac users)
